* <b>[Hotel Booking Cancelation Prediction](Hotel_Booking_Cancellation_Prediction/HotelBookingCancellationPrediction.html)</b><br>The objective of the project is to analyse the data provided to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations, build a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be cancelled in advance, and help in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.
* <b>[Netflix Movie Recommendation](Netflix_Movie_Recommendation/NetflixMovieRecommendation.html)</b><br>The objective of this project is to build a recommendation system to recommend movies to users based on the ratings given to different movies by the users.
